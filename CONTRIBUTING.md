# Contributing to Claire

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Calire.

## Where do I go from here?

If you've noticed a bug or have a feature request, make sure to check our [issues](https://github.com/pratham-jaiswal/claire/issues) if there's something similar to what you've observed or want to suggest. If there isn't, feel free to open a new issue!

## Fork & create a branch

If this is something you think you can fix, then fork the repository and create a branch with a descriptive name.

A good branch name would be (where issue #1 is the ticket you're working on):
```bash
git checkout -b feature/1-fix-something
```
